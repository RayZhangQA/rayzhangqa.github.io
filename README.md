# This is the website of RayZ's Quality Assurance House

In my more than 10 years of QA career. I used to learn a lot of corresponding technical knowledges and courses by myself, and keep taking notes and doing the homeworks. Accumulated quite rich experiences and skills. I want to set up such a website to record what I have learned, so that I can not only review but also share my learning results.

A business/corporate style responsive site template. It's pretty barebones but should
go over pretty well for folks wanting to get their serious business on.
